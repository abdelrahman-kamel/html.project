The programming language consists of vocabulary that contains a set of operational rules that aim to transfer instructions to a computer or any digital computing device to perform specific tasks, and each programming language contains a unique set of keywords along with a special structure to organize the program instructions.

There are low-level and high-level programming languages, which although simple compared to human languages ​​are more complicated than machine languages, low-level languages ​​include assembly languages, assembly language contains a list of basic instructions and is more difficult to read than high-level language, on the other hand High-level languages ​​are designed to be easy to read and understand, allowing programmers to write source codes naturally using words and logical codes.

With the continuous development of computers and all digital devices, we find that hundreds of different programming languages ​​have been created for different types of development, and therefore the field of programming is very broad, so the use of a particular language will depend on the goals to be achieved, for example many of the following activities such as developing Programs and applications, artificial intelligence development, database development, video game development, driver and hardware interface development, web and web development in addition to script development</body>
